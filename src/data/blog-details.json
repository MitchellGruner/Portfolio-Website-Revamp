        "title": "The Impact of AI on the Future of Web Development",
        "paragraph": "AI has overtaken and impacted nearly every industry in what seems like overnight, and no industry has arguably felt its effects more heavily than web development. With tools such as #ChatGPT and Google Gemini becoming accessible to the masses (even to people in non-technical industries!) and arriving at ideas and answers to questions in mere seconds, itâ€™s hard not to worry about what impact these tools may have on replacing developers in the future."
