        "title": "The Impact of AI on the Future of Web Development",
        "paragraph1": "AI has overtaken and impacted nearly every industry in what seems like overnight, and no industry has arguably felt its effects more heavily than web development. With tools such as #ChatGPT and Google Gemini becoming accessible to the masses (even to people in non-technical industries!) and arriving at ideas and answers to questions in mere seconds, it’s hard not to worry about what impact these tools may have on replacing developers in the future.",
        "header1": "Here’s why this is a game changer…",
        "paragraph2": "Web development #AI assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, can even debug and write code at senior developer levels at times. The most worrisome assistant to web developers, however, is Devin AI, better known as “the world’s first fully autonomous AI software engineer”, according to Cognition Labs. DevinAI automation has the opportunity to eliminate overhead costs for a corporation by employing a “cost-free” software engineer, or reducing the salaries of human software engineers since their services won’t be as valuable now that their job is partially (or fully) automated. With all this automation breaking onto the scene so rapidly, should we as web developers be fearful for our jobs?<br />To answer that question, we must first understand the impact AI has already made on a global scale. It’s important to understand that while recent trends have suggested that AI is a revolutionary tool used across all industries, it is not particularly “new”; AI computers have been around since the 50s and top chess players have lost to AI ever since the 90s. With that being said, AI wasn’t accessible to the mainstream just three years ago; now you’ll become hard-pressed to find anyone who hasn’t used AI in some form or another. Although AI has indeed advanced far more than anyone could have predicted, the idea that AI will replace software development jobs is a futile argument for many reasons.",
        "header2": "Why we don’t have to fear…",
        "paragraph3": "Although AI tools such as #ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Adobe Sensei can understand code as much, if not more, than a typical software engineer, it’s important to realize that these tools won’t take away our jobs anytime soon. Firstly, no tech company is going to put their entire trust in Devin AI and let him run the show; there are far too many liabilities with replacing developers at a large scale like this since this is an extremely new technology that has yet to be tested in this manner. On top of this, being a software engineer is much more than just writing code; you need interpersonal skills, problem-solving capabilities, time management attributes, soft skills, organization, and finally a sense of leadership. No AI can replace the human-to-human element of business anytime soon, and writing software is just part of what you do anyway. Secondly, just because big tech is embracing AI, doesn’t mean that small companies are as well. Colleges need web developers to manage their websites, and small companies also need talented developers without the overhead and turmoil of managing AI.<br />So let’s just say that ten years from now, AI takes off and makes you replaceable as a developer - This is a very real possibility considering the effects and impact AI has had just over the past year or two. So how can we avoid this? The short and comforting answer to this question is that after ten years working in the industry, you’ll inevitably move to a more “senior” position in your career, making you almost irreplaceable and valued by your employer. You’ll more than likely be in a position where you don’t need to produce automatable software as your primary job requirement, making you less susceptible to AI trends. If not, there are plenty of other technology roles that won’t fall victim to the rise of AI, such as cybersecurity, information security, and of course, AI and machine learning.",
        "header3": "With all of this being said…",
        "paragraph4": "AI is here to stay, whether we like it or not. We must embrace this change as a tool rather than a hindrance to our future development endeavors. WordPress and other CMS systems didn’t completely wipe out web developers, despite the uproar and seemingly “doomsday-esque” thoughts from the tech community, so why should we have to fear AI? I use GitHub Copilot and I can confidently say that it has vastly improved my development skills, and has (more importantly) saved me so much time debugging and developing software. Gone are the days of ignoring AI in web development, and I am so appreciative and happy that these tools exist for a multitude of reasons. The bottom line: there is absolutely nothing to fear with AI when it comes to development, so embrace the change and utilize it to your advantage!"
